Following the philosophy of my blog, this will be a very specific post. You can find many resources on the internet about how to deploy a web app.
I will even be referencing many of those here. But the main difference with those posts is that mine is going to be straight to the point.
The following is a tutorial on how to create a web app from scratch. The backend will be on Django and the database will be Postgresql.
The app will be running on AWS and to deploy it there we will create a Docker image. Last but not least, I'll explain how to buy a domain and link the domain to the AWS ip address. Let's get ours hands dirty!

### Postgresql server setup

### Example model


## Docker


## AWS

### Account and IAM roles

### ECS cluster setup
