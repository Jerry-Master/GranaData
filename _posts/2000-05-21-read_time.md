The way the reading time is computed is quite easy. It follows this formula

<div>$$ \frac{\text{Number of words in the post}}{\text{Average reading speed in words / min}} $$</div>

The average reading speed for college students is assumed to be 300 words per minute, according to [this page](https://irisreading.com/what-is-the-average-reading-speed/), for normal text. If there are formulas and new concepts I use 100 words per minute. When the post is very short, the time is simply $<1$ less than one minute, like this one. Also, the words are counted by copying the whole raw text with html tags into [this page](https://wordcounter.net/), and the result is rounded up so it may be bigger than expected.
