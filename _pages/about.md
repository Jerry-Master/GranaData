<!-- About -->
<div class="col-md-8 pr-5">

<p>This blog was bornt from my need to explain everything that I have learnt during my degrees and to show to the world the results of my research in a more divulgative way.</p>

<p>The name from the blog was inspired from the love I have for the place I belong: Granada, and the love I have for Data Science. As you may have noticed, the footer image is of La Alhambra, as it couldn't be otherwise.</p>

<p>About me I can say that I always have many things in mind, but seldom have time to put them in practice. Below is a photo of me surrounded by olives, you cannot see it but behind the camera there was a rally. I hope you enjoy my blog.</p>
